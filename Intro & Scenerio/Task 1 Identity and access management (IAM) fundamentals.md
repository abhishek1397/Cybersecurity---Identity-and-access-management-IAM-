## 🔑 **Key Concepts of IAM**  
IAM ensures that the right individuals have the appropriate access to digital resources while minimising security risks.  

1️⃣ **Digital Identity**  
A digital identity represents a user within a system and includes attributes such as:  
- Username  
- Password  
- Additional identifying information  

2️⃣ **Authentication**  
Verification of the identity of a user or system to ensure that the entity attempting access is legitimate.  
**Common methods include:**  
- Password-based authentication  
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)  
- Biometric authentication  

3️⃣ **Authorisation**  
Determines what actions or resources a verified user is allowed to access.  
**Authorisation is often based on:**  
- Roles  
- Permissions  
- Access control lists (ACLs)  

4️⃣ **Single Sign-On (SSO)**  
Allows users to log in once and gain access to multiple connected systems without re-entering credentials.  
✅ **Benefits:**  
- Enhances user experience  
- Improves security  

5️⃣ **Least Privilege Principle**  
Ensures that users are granted the minimum level of access necessary to perform their job functions.  
✅ **Advantages:**  
- Minimises unauthorised access  
- Reduces security risks

✅ **IAM: A Strategic Imperative**  
IAM enhances security, streamlines access management, and empowers organisations to navigate the digital age confidently.  

🚀 **Let's Get Started!** 🎉

## 🏦 Financial Institution Security Enhancement  

In the dynamic world of finance, trust and security are the cornerstones of institutions like **XYZ Bank**. Facing an escalating wave of **insider fraud** and growing concerns about **data breaches**, XYZ Bank recognised the urgent need to safeguard customer trust, protect its reputation, and mitigate financial risks. To address these challenges, the bank initiated a comprehensive **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** project to enhance its security posture.  

---

### 🔐 **IAM Solution**  
XYZ Bank embarked on a **comprehensive IAM transformation** to strengthen authentication and access controls across its branches and offices.  

### 🔑 **MFA Implementation**
